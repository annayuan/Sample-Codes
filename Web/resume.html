			<h3>Experience</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Associate Engineer: HollySys Automation Technology (Summer Intern)</h4>
					<p>
						<ol class="content">
							<li>Schematic and PCB design of a 24V 14-way Digital Output Module on 120mm*60mm*1.6mm, 4-layer board.</li>
							<li>Accomplished product specifications design, FMEA (Multisim), derating design analysis and completed relevant documentation including principle specification and technique requirements.</li>
							<li>Instructed manufacturing and tested product's input, output, back-read and 40 connection pins' working situation with and without 24V DC input and completed test report.</li>
						</ol>

				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Associate Product Manager: Jingoal (Summer Intern)</h4>
					<ol class="content">
						<li>Summarized dis/advantages of over 50 webpages and proposed new ideas to improve Homepage design.</li>
						<li>Assisted product manager to hold daily meetings, checked process with technical and marketing groups and tested frequently on both websites and clients.</li>

			<h3>Projects</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4>Data Collection, Topic Modeling and Collaborative Filtering (Python & Matlab)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Implemented a crawler to collect topic_id, answer_id and user_id from "Quora", employed Selenium to access websites and applied Beautiful Soup package to parse html elements.</li>
						<li>Processed the data to find 20 most frequent key words for each topic based on "Latent Dirichlet Allocation", estimated probabilities of topics, documents with Bayesian estimator and derived topic distribution.</li>
						<li>Recommended movies by Machine Learning with Alternating Least Square method for Collaborative Filtering based on user ratings. Randomly separated known entries where 90% for training and 10% for testing. Trained the data with least square factorization and tested our prediction by calculating hit rate and false_alarm rate.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Data Structure and Algorithms (Java)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Designed a stamp vending machine by Dynamic Programming, which outputted the minimum number of stamps when entering total value of stamps needed.</li>
						<li>Designed a Card Game and then extended to BlackJack Game with a game automator, applying Object-Oriented Design.</li>
						<li>Implemented Queue and Stack with Linked List and Circular Array including basic functions such as adding, deleting new elements and return the top element.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Image Deblurring by Convex Optimization (M.S. Graduation Project)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Launched a constrained convex optimization problem by setting objective function as sum of Huber Penalty and "iso" norm and then reconstructed it with primal-dual splitting method.</li>
						<li>Improved the performance of proximal operator of Huber Penalty by applying Moreau Yosida Regularization.</li>
						<li>Deblurred "Salt & Pepper" and "Gaussian" noisy gray-scaled images through Chambolle-Pock algorithm.</li>
					</ol>	
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>2D Digital Image Processing (C & Matlab)</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Implemented image transform through DCT, DFT, histogram equalization and frequency domain filtering.</li>
						<li>Performed image edge detection by deriving row and column gradients with 8-adjacent pixels and compared effects by testing with different values of threshold.</li>
					</ol>
